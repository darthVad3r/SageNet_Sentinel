## Fraud Detector App

This repository contains an application designed to detect fraudulent activities leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning technologies. The app utilizes [ML.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet) for local model development and integrates with [AWS SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) to improve prediction accuracy and reduce false positives in fraud detection scenarios.

Key features:
- **Machine Learning Models**: Built and trained using ML.NET for easy integration with .NET applications.
- **AWS SageMaker Integration**: Offloads complex model training and inference to AWS, allowing for scalable and robust fraud detection.
- **False Positive Reduction**: Incorporates advanced techniques to minimize legitimate activity being flagged as fraud, delivering better customer experience and trust.
- **Flexible & Extensible**: Designed for easy customization and expansion to fit a variety of fraud detection needs.

This app is ideal for organizations seeking efficient, scalable, and accurate fraud detection with modern .NET and cloud-based ML workflows.
